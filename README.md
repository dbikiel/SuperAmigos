Analysis of superheroes card game

Remember those cardgames of superheros when you were a kid? Superman was A1, and Flash was the fastest, and the bad guys really suck...

The other day, I was playing with my nephew and he asked me which one I preferred between two cards. So a lot of question arised? besides that it seems easy (there are only a few cards and you can see all their attributes) it was a nice way to practice some analysis and some simulations.

So, how you define which card is the best? and the second one? And there is an optimal way to play?

Check it...
